# Share-Ryde
ShareRyde is a mobile app platform connecting car owners with renters, allowing owners to monetize their underutilized vehicles while providing affordable transportation options. The project utilized critical path methodology, work breakdown structure (WBS), and cost breakdown structure (CBS) for effective planning and execution. Technical project management involved milestone tracking, risk assessment using likelihood/consequence analysis, robust schedule management with contingency planning, and resource optimization strategies. The $2 million budget was managed through detailed cost mitigation approaches while the team employed systematic performance tracking and recovery protocols to ensure timely delivery within the 97-day timeline.
